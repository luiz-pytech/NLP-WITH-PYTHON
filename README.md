# NLP WITH PYTHON: Challenges and Studies

## 📖 About The Project

This repository was created as a practical study project to consolidate the knowledge acquired in a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course, inspired by the DataCamp learning track. The goal is to practically apply the main techniques and tools of the NLP ecosystem in Python, from fundamental text manipulation to the implementation of advanced models with the Hugging Face `transformers` library.

Each folder corresponds to a chapter of the course and contains notebooks with challenging exercises designed to reinforce theoretical learning with real-world implementation.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

The journey through this repository covers the essential pillars of Natural Language Processing:

1.  **Fundamentals of Text Processing:** Text preparation and cleaning techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, normalization (lowercasing), stemming, and lemmatization.

2.  **Feature Extraction:** Methods for transforming text into numerical representations that Machine Learning models can understand, such as **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**, **TF-IDF**, and the exploration of **Word Embeddings** (Word2Vec, GloVe).

3.  **Text Classification with Hugging Face:** Leveraging the power of pre-trained models (*transformers*) for advanced tasks such as **Sentiment Analysis**, **Zero-Shot Classification**, semantic similarity checking, and grammar correction.

4.  **Token Classification and Text Generation:** Modern applications such as **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging, **automatic summarization**, **translation**, and **text generation**, also using Hugging Face pipelines.

## 📊 Dataset Used

For the exploration and development of the notebooks in this project, the **Olist Public E-commerce Dataset** was used.

This is a real, anonymized dataset containing information on over 100,000 orders placed at various marketplaces in Brazil between 2016 and 2018. The richness of its textual data, such as customer reviews and product descriptions, makes it an ideal dataset for Natural Language Processing (NLP) studies and applications.
